Hello Ingrid,



Fantastic work meeting all requirements for this unsupervised learning and cryptocurrency clustering challenge! You exhibited strong skills in data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, clustering algorithms, and extracting insights.



The elbow method implementation to find the optimal k value for clustering demonstrated proficiency in selecting appropriate models. Reducing dimensions through PCA and determining explained variance revealed solid understanding of feature extraction techniques.



Fitting K-Means models on both original and PCA datasets, predicting clusters, and visualizing the results showed your ability to refine solutions iteratively. Identifying feature weights provided interpretability into the PCA components.



Overall, you completed a comprehensive unsupervised learning project spanning critical stages like data cleaning, dimensionality reduction, cluster analysis and results interpretation. Keep up the amazing work!
