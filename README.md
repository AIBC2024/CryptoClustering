# CryptoClustering
Unsupervised Machine Learning - K-means and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) Homework AI Bootcamp due 2/25/2025

## Project Overview
1. From crypto_market_data.csv file create data frames, follow instructions from Jupyter Notebook
2. Apply my understanding of the K-means algorithm and PCA to classify cryptocurrencies acording to their price fluctuations across various timeframes. Examine price changes over intervals spanning 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year.

## How I did my work
1. Follow the instructions on the Jupyter Notebook starter file
2. Use lesson 11_1, 11_2, and 11_3 for the command lines
3. Read more on the https://scikit-learn.org/ and in depth search via Claude AI
4. Debug and test multiple times

## Output Examples
